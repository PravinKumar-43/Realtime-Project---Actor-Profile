Here is a small Project
First we are creating a Repository 
In the main Branch we are creating a HTML file 
Then we are creating two branch replicate of main branch name as user1 and user2


User1 will make change in the HTML file and merge that with main branch

User2 will pull the latest content from main Branch and then he will edit and push to main branch
